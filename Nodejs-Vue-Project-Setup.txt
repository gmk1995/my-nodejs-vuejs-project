Vue CLI is a command line interface tool that makes it easy to create and manage Vue.js projects.

You can install Vue CLI globally by running the command in your terminal :

Once Vue CLI is installed, you can use it to create a new Vue.js Project

To create a new project, run the following command in your terminal:

vue create my-project

Replace "my-project" with the name of your project. This command will create a new Vue.js project in a directory called "my-project".

Step 4: Run the Development Server:

You can start the development server by running thr following command:

cd my-project

npm run serve

This will start a development server on http://localhost:8080/, and you can see your new Vue.js app in action bu opening a web browser and visting that URL.
